### Recent Projects

* tuberculosis SeveriTy Assessment Tool for Informed Stratification (TB-STATIS)     
  A statistical model to integrate diagnostic information at time of tuberculosis diagnosis to generate clinical phenotypes of TB disease severity. R package to implement TB-STATIS is [here.](https://github.com/samalatesta/tbSTATIS)

  Malatesta S, Jacobson KR, Horsburgh CR, Farhat MR, Gile KJ, Kolaczyk ED, White LF. An Integrated Data-Driven Model for Clinical Phenotyping of Tuberculosis Disease Severity.

* Semi-parametric randomization test for continuous association (SPRTCA)    
  A statistical test to infer bivariate association between two variables collected using respondent-driven sampling that accounts for sample correlation from peer-recruitment. R package to implement SPRTCA is [here.](https://github.com/samalatesta/RDSAssociation)
