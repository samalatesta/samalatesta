### About Me       
I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Boston University Clinical HIV/AIDS Research Training Program](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/id/research-programs/bu-chart/) at Boston Medical Center. I earned my PhD in Biostatistics from Boston University where I developed statistical methods for understanding tuberculosis disease dynamics among key populations. My current work focuses on applying various modeling techniques to learn about TB transmission and developing statistical methods for understanding infectious disease transmission that integrate pathogen whole genome sequencing and individual-level clinical data.

### Interests 
statistical methods | data integration | infectious diseases | transmission modeling | tuberculosis

### Recent Projects

* tuberculosis SeveriTy Assessment Tool for Informed Stratification (TB-STATIS)     
  A statistical model to integrate diagnostic information at time of tuberculosis diagnosis to generate clinical phenotypes of TB disease severity. Documentation and a tutorial are available [here.](https://samalatesta.github.io/tbSTATIS/index.html)

  Malatesta S, Jacobson KR, Horsburgh CR, Farhat MR, Gile KJ, Kolaczyk ED, White LF. An Integrated Data-Driven Model for Clinical Phenotyping of Tuberculosis Disease Severity.

* Semi-parametric randomization test for continuous association (SPRTCA)    
  A statistical test to infer bivariate association between two variables collected using respondent-driven sampling that accounts for sample correlation from peer-recruitment. R package to implement SPRTCA is [here.](https://github.com/samalatesta/RDSAssociation)
