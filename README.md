### About Me       
I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Boston University Clinical HIV/AIDS Research Training Program](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/id/research-programs/bu-chart/) at Boston Medical Center. I earned my PhD in Biostatistics from Boston University where I developed statistical methods for understanding tuberculosis disease dynamics among key populations. My current work focuses on  statistical methods for understanding infectious disease transmission that integrates pathogen whole genome sequencing and individual-level clinical data. I am particularly interested in settings with both a high TB and HIV burden where community transmission is common. 

### Interests 
statistical methods | data integration | infectious diseases | transmission modeling | tuberculosis

### Recent Projects

* tuberculosis SeveriTy Assessment Tool for Informed Stratification (TB-STATIS)     
  A statistical model to integrate diagnostic information at time of tuberculosis diagnosis to generate clinical phenotypes of TB disease severity. R package to implement TB-STATIS is [here.](https://github.com/samalatesta/tbSTATIS)

* Semi-parametric randomization test for continuous association (SPRTCA)    
  A statistical test to infer bivariate association between two variables collected using respondent-driven sampling that accounts for sample correlation from peer-recruitment. R package to implement SPRTCA is [here.](https://github.com/samalatesta/RDSAssociation)
