### About Me       
I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Boston University Clinical HIV/AIDS Research Training Program](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/id/research-programs/bu-chart/) at Boston Medical Center. I earned my PhD in Biostatistics from Boston University where I developed statistical methods for understanding tuberculosis disease dynamics among key populations. My current work focuses on applying various modeling techniques to learn about TB transmission and developing statistical methods for understanding infectious disease transmission that integrate pathogen whole genome sequencing and individual-level clinical data.

### Interests 
statistical methods | data integration | infectious diseases | transmission modeling | tuberculosis
